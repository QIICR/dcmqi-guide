# Installation

`dcmqi` is a collection of libraries and command line tools. It is currently possible to install `dcmqi` using one of the following approaches:

1. Using [docker](docker.md)
2. [Build from source](build_dcmqi.md)
3. [From 3D Slicer extension](slicer_extension.md)

We are also working on providing a downloadable binaries of `dcmqi` independent of the 3D Slicer application. This option will be supported in the future.
