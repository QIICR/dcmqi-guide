# About

This is user guide for the [dcmqi](https://github.com/qiicr/dcmqi) \(DICOM for Quantitative Imaging\) library.

With `dcmqi` you can:

* Convert certain types of image and analysis results into standardized DICOM form. This can help you with
 * sharing data in archives like [TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
 * interoperating with PACS and commercial tools
 * supporting data queries to both image data and analysis results
 * standardizing data semantics
 * making your data self-described and better prepared for new uses
* Convert DICOM data into a commonly used research file formats like JSON and NIfTI.
* Integrate DICOM concepts into your analysis workflows so that intermediate results are encoded in a standardized manner, making it easy to share your data.

# Quick start
