# Introduction

### About

This is user guide for the [dcmqi](https://github.com/qiicr/dcmqi) \(DICOM for Quantitative Imaging\) library.

With `dcmqi` you can:

* Convert certain types of [quantitative image analysis](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0962280214537333) results into standardized DICOM form. This can help you with
  * sharing data in archives like [TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
  * interoperating with PACS and commercial tools
  * supporting data queries to both image data and analysis results
  * standardizing data semantics
  * making your data self-described and better prepared for new uses
* Convert DICOM data into a commonly used research file formats like JSON and NIfTI.
* Integrate DICOM concepts into your analysis workflows so that intermediate results are encoded in a standardized manner, making it easy to share your data.
